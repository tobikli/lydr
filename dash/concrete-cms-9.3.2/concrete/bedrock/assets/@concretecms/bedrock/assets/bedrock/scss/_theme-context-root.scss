// What is the purpose of this file, you ask?
// In our theme color input selector, we use CSS variables to display colors.
// e.g. var(--bs-primary)
// However, since .ccm-ui has the CMS variables attached to it, and the ::root has the
// theme bootstrap variables attached to it, the primary color shown in the color input
// Will come from .ccm-ui instead of ::root, since .ccm-ui is inside ::root.
// So instead, let's ALSO define the theme colors against the .ccm-context-theme
// class, and then wrap any controls that need to have access to theme specific variables
// within the .ccm-context-theme class.

.ccm-context-theme {

  @each $color, $value in $theme-colors {
    --#{$variable-prefix}#{$color}: #{$value};
  }

}
